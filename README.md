# Landing Page for a startup business:
 This is a small landing page that I created for a Singapore Based B2B company. Just used basic Front-End technologies.
 
 # One Page Website - Digital Marketing Training:
 A one page website I created for a Malaysian Training Company. 
 For Front-End is pretty simple and for back-end I used php and mysql to collect the data and store the leads. Also used SMTL email service for the auto email sending method. Used PHPMailer Library.
